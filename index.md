The **Software Defined Network Function Virtualization** (SDNFV) project is a research collaboration spanning University of California Riverside and George Washington University, led by [K.K. Ramakrishnan](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~kk/) and [Tim Wood](http://faculty.cs.gwu.edu/~timwood/wiki/doku.php). We seek to build highly dynamic software-based networks that provide far greater flexibility than hardware-based approaches, yet still obtain high performance and low cost.  

The basis for much of our research is **openNetVM**, a [DPDK](http://dpdk.org) based high performance NFV platform that allows network functions such as network monitors, switches, etc. to be deployed in [Docker](http://www.docker.com) containers.  **openNetVM** is SDN-enabled, allowing the network controller to provide rules that dictate what network functions need to process each packet flow.

Our work is supported in part by NSF grants CNS-1422362 and CNS-1522546.

## Software Releases

We expect to have a release of **openNetVM** ready for beta testing in *Summer 2015*.
